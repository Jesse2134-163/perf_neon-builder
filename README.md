# Background
The naming, Perf Neon, is inspired by a Linux Distribution called KDE Neon, where KDE take latest Ubuntu LTS as a base system and then put Latest KDE on top of it. Same thing as Perf Neon, where i take whatever the world the LineageOS, CrDroid and PixelOS team put under their kernel source and then put minimal patches on top of it.   

# What is it for?
This kernel solely focuses on adding goodies on top of the stock kernel, which fulfill the dream of a purists, where they want everything stable and rock solid from their stock kernels but also wanted extra spices on top of it.   

# Release schedules
This kernel follows weekly builds of LineageOS, you will get a new kernel build every sunday. You might need to check out the GitHub repo for new releases. Emergency rebuilt might happen if services that this builder rely on being broken or kernel source code have massive changes.   

# Features
All kernels are exclusively compiled with **Neutron Clang**.

**File Namings**   
`neon-<OS/KernelName>-<DeviceName>-<Platform>-<BuildDate>.zip`   
- **neon:** Label indicator telling the user this kernel is built on Perf Neon Builder.
- **OS/KernelName:** Operating System or Kernel names.
- **DeviceName:** Codename of the device.
- **Platform:** Chipset or platform identifier.
- **BuildDate:** When the kernel was compiled.

**Notes**
- During the usage of Droidspaces with systemd-based distros, mask the `NetworkManager` and `wpa_supplicant` systemd services to avoid overriding whos owning the wifi device, a.k.a NetworkManager will take control of the wifi device and android will not be able to connect to wifi until you masked the systemd services.

**Notes**   
- We recommend installing LineageOS, CrDroid and PixelOS kernels on their respective OS.   
- AwakenOS is upstreamed PixelOS kernels. This usually have newer commits before it got merged into the official PixelOS kernel sources.   
- LineageOS (SM6125) kernel might run on PixelOS for the respective device.
- Mi-Thorium kernels doesn't have any OS constraints.   
- Akari & Mi8953 build for Mi-Titanium kernels contains 2 different way of handling USB, Media and Camera stack. If Mi8953 build feels broken to you pick the Akari build instead.
- Don't forget to flash appender after flashing the kernel if you're using bootloader bypass exploit on MSM8937 devices.
- Your device aren't yet supported? Go to the telegram channel to request your device for support.   

# Installation
**On Recovery**   
- Download both the flashable zip of the custom kernel and the original boot & dtbo image for your device as a backup.   
- Flash or Sideload the flashable zip with `adb sideload </path/to/flashable.zip>`  
- Allow to continue if you see Error 21 signature invalid.   
- Reboot to system.   
- Install lastest KernelSU Manager from [here](https://github.com/Baka-SU/BakaSU/releases). (Optional)
- Profit.   

**On BakaSU Manager**   
- On BakaSU Manager, click the "Working" card on the Manager Home Screen.   
- You'll see both LKM and flash AnyKernel3, choose AnyKernel3, and select the flashable zip.   
- Click next and the flashable will be installed.   
- Reboot.   
- Profit.   

**Restore to default kernel**   
- You'll need to remove everything inside `/data/adb`. You can do this with `su -c rm -rf /data/adb/*`.   
- Then immediately reboot to bootloader/fastbootd.   
- Flash the stock boot image with `fastboot flash boot </path/to/original/boot/image.img>`   
- Also flash the stock dtbo image with `fastboot flash dtbo </path/to/original/dtbo/image.img>`
- Reboot with `fastboot reboot`.   
- Profit.   

**Notes**   
You can install different KernelSU Manager with BakaSU kernel drivers. This is currently supported KernelSU Managers:   
- [Original KernelSU](github.com/tiann/KernelSU) (tiann)    
- [BakaSU Manager](github.com/Baka-SU/BakaSU) (BakaSU Developers)   
- [KOW's KernelSU](github.com/KOWX712/KernelSU) (KOWX712)
